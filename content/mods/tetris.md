#### Requirements:
- [NVSE](https://github.com/xNVSE/NVSE/releases/latest)﻿
- [UIO](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/57174)
- [JIP LN NVSE﻿](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/58277)

#### How to play:

Pick up a cartridge on a table near a terminal in Prospector Saloon in Goodsprings. You can also use a console command **player.additem XX00442A**, where **XX** is mod's index in the load order. After that, just click on the Tetris in the Misc tab of your inventory.

**Keyboard controls are:** Arrow Left/Right/Down to move the block, Arrow Up to rotate the block, Spacebar to pause, and Q to quit.

**Xbox controller bindings are:** D-pad Left/Right/Down to move the block, D-pad Up to rotate the block, Right Thumbstick to pause, and X to quit.

Blocks fall down every 900 ms by default, speed increases by 10% every level.
