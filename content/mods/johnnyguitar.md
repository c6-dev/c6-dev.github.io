JohnnyGuitar NVSE is an engine plugin for New Vegas that adds new script functions, features and bug fixes.

#### Script Functions

- 150+ new functions and 10+ event handlers, including WorldToScreen, SetVelEx, GetTimePlayed and more.
- Complete list of added functions with documentation and examples can be found on GECK Wiki.


#### New features

- **Runtime Editor IDs:** GECK Editor IDs can now be used in game console (e.g. "player.additem weap10mmpistol") and in scripts as dynamic string variables using GetEditorID and EditorIDToFormID functions. Additionally, Editor IDs are now displayed when you select a reference without a name in game console.
- **Custom Map Marker Icons:** SetCustomMapMarkerIcon function lets you override hardcoded map marker icons with your own.
- **Level Up Menu Toggle:** ToggleLevelUpMenu and IsLevelUpMenuEnabled functions let you disable or delay level up menu display.
- **Event Framework:** JGCreateEvent and JGFreeEvent functions are exported to allow other plugin authors to take advantage of JohnnyGuitar's event system. See headers in events folder in the source code for example usage.
