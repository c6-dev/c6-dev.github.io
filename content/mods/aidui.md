Active Ingestibles Duration UI or AidUI adds a HUD for consumed Aid items that shows the time until their effects run out.

The .ini with some configuration options is available in **Data/Config/AidUI/AidUI.ini**. By default, only Chems are enabled.

Comes with MCM support thanks to TommInfinite.

#### Known issues:

- Some icons are off-centered - the mod uses vanilla inventory icons, i can't prevent it on my side.
- After drinking several different alcoholic beverages only one icon is displayed - the game treats them as a single item if their effects are identical.
